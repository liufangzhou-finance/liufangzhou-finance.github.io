      <strong>Managerial Horizon and Corporate Innovation</strong> <span class="muted">(joint with Evgeny Lyandres and Chen Xu, working paper)</span><br/>
      <span class="muted">Abstract: This paper develops a novel, large language model (LLM)–based measure of managerial horizon using managers’ language in earnings calls.
        Leveraging a hybrid GPT–BERT framework, we classify millions of transcript segments into performance, strategy, and activity content and construct a firm-quarter
        measure of managerial short-termism based on the relative emphasis on performance. Firms with more short-term–oriented managerial language exhibit lower R\&D and capital investment,
        weaker innovation output, slower earnings growth, and poorer long-run stock performance. The effects are economically meaningful and strongest among opaque firms, 
        demonstrating that narrative disclosure reveals managers’ intertemporal preferences and has real valuation implications.</span>

      <strong>Analyst Coverage and Innovation: Evidence from New Product Introduction</strong> <span class="muted">(Working Paper)</span><br/>
      <span class="muted">Abstract:This paper investigates the relationship between analyst coverage and new product introductions. We use product-level information on consumer packaged goods to identify breakthrough
        and incremental innovations. Our findings show that analyst coverage positively impacts both breakthrough and incremental innovations. These results remain robust after controlling for firm heterogeneity, time-varying product market shocks, 
        and through quasi-experiments using brokerage mergers and closures. We also show that analysts' emphasis on radical innovation predicts future breakthrough innovations and higher product announcement returns. 
        Overall, our findings suggest that firms respond to analyst pressure by introducing more innovations that align with analysts' preferences. </span>
